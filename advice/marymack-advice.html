              <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
              <p>When you start programming, you're doing something you've never done before!
                It's OK to face confusion; it means you're embarking on new knowledge.</p>

              <h4>Parlez-vous Code?</h4>
              <p>Learning to code is similar to learning a new language. It takes time to understand
                the vernacular. But it will come; the more you use it, the more you'll retain.</p>
